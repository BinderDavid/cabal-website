cabal-website
=============

The http://www.haskell.org/cabal/ website.

Currently contains everything except `release/` and `darcs_/` (which should be
deleted anyway).

The [`gh-pages`](https://github.com/haskell/cabal-website/tree/gh-pages) branch of this repo is used for automated deployment of Cabal API documentation.
